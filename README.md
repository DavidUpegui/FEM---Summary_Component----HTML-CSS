## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Reset.css file

### What I learned

I use this challenge for timing myself and testing a reset css file. I learned how the reset work and where import it. Also I applied some custom properties, something I am not used to use.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my mi abilities for be a lot efficient while working. Also, keep in mind the cutom properties, they are a powerull tool and I think I am not using it at 100%.
